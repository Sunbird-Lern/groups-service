# Play Framework 3.0.5 and Apache Pekko 1.0.3 Upgrade

## Overview

This document describes the upgrade of groups-service from Play Framework 2.7.2 with Akka 2.5.22 to Play Framework 3.0.5 with Apache Pekko 1.0.3.

## Why This Upgrade

1. License Compliance: Akka changed from Apache 2.0 to Business Source License 1.1, requiring commercial licenses for production use. Apache Pekko maintains Apache 2.0 license.
2. Security: Play 2.7.2 and Akka 2.5.22 no longer receive security updates.
3. Modernization: Access to latest features and performance improvements.

## Technology Stack Changes

- Play Framework: 2.7.2 to 3.0.5
- Actor Framework: Akka 2.5.22 to Apache Pekko 1.0.3
- Scala: 2.12.11 to 2.13.12
- SLF4J: 1.6.1 to 2.0.9
- Logback: 1.0.7 to 1.4.14
- Jackson: 2.13.5 to 2.14.3
- Netty: 4.1.44 to 4.1.93

## Key Changes

### Dependencies

All Maven POM files updated with new versions. Play Framework groupId changed from com.typesafe.play to org.playframework. Scala library exclusions added to prevent version conflicts between Scala 2.12 and 2.13.

### Source Code

All Akka imports migrated to Pekko across Java files:
- akka.actor.* to org.apache.pekko.actor.*
- akka.event.* to org.apache.pekko.event.*
- akka.pattern.* to org.apache.pekko.pattern.*
- akka.routing.* to org.apache.pekko.routing.*
- akka.util.* to org.apache.pekko.util.*
- akka.testkit.* to org.apache.pekko.testkit.*
- akka.stream.* to org.apache.pekko.stream.*

### Configuration

application.conf files updated with Pekko namespaces:
- akka configuration blocks changed to pekko
- Actor system configurations migrated
- Serialization bindings updated
- Dispatcher references changed
- Logger references updated to Pekko

### Scala API Updates

- scala.compat.java8.FutureConverters updated to scala.jdk.javaapi.FutureConverters
- FutureConverters.toJava() changed to FutureConverters.asJava()

## Build Instructions

Build all modules:
```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

Create distribution package:
```
cd service
mvn play2:dist
```

## Migration Impact

Business Logic: No changes to business logic or functionality
API Compatibility: Maintained, as Pekko is API-compatible with Akka 2.6
Code Changes: Primarily package name updates from akka to pekko
License: Now compliant with Apache 2.0 throughout the stack


## Files Modified

- POM files (dependency management)
- Java source files (import migrations)
- Configuration files (namespace updates)

## Known Issues

Test Failures: Some unit tests fail due to PowerMock compatibility with Java 11 module system. This is a known PowerMock issue unrelated to the Pekko migration. The compilation and build are fully successful.

Scala Version Conflicts: If you encounter NoClassDefFoundError for scala.collection.GenMap, verify dependency tree to ensure no Scala 2.12 artifacts are present. Run mvn dependency:tree and add exclusions for any scala-library or scala-reflect with version 2.12.
